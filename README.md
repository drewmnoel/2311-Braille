# Player

## TODO
* Create a file parser to parse an input file format
* Create an audio player to play files, given a string

# Simulator

## Left to do
* ~~Programmatically generate buttons (e.g. create 3 buttons, 1 button)~~
* ~~Write button handlers (use handlers so we can define behavior outside class)~~
* ~~Document (JavaDoc) all methods and loops~~
* ~~Extract functionality to an API for later use~~
* ~~JUnit tests for API and common modules~~
* ~~Remove duplicate/unused methods/classes (e.g. there are several mains)~~
* Rename classes / methods to be more clear what they do (e.g. CreateCells is GUI's main)
* ~~Translate support for capitals/numbers~~
