# Simulator

## Left to do
* Programmatically generate buttons (e.g. create 3 buttons, 1 button)
* Write button handlers (use handlers so we can define behavior outside class)
* Document (JavaDoc) all methods and loops
* Extract functionality to an API for later use
* JUnit tests for API and common modules
* ~~Remove duplicate/unused methods/classes (e.g. there are several mains)~~
* Rename classes / methods to be more clear what they do (e.g. CreateCells is GUI's main)
* Translate support for capitals/numbers
